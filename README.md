# 📸 Historical Photo Colorization Using AI

This project focuses on colorizing black and white historical images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, we can bring life back into grayscale photos, giving users a glimpse into the past with realistic colorization.
