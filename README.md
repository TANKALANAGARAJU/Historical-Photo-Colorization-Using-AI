# 📸 Historical Photo Colorization Using AI

This project focuses on colorizing black and white historical images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, we can bring life back into grayscale photos, giving users a glimpse into the past with realistic colorization.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Model Used**: Pre-trained Caffe model (`colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt` and `.caffemodel`)
- 🖼️ **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Streamlit
- 🧪 **Techniques**: Deep learning, image processing
- 🌐 **Frontend**: Simple and interactive UI using Streamlit
- 🏁 **Goal**: Enhance old photographs by adding realistic colors automatically
